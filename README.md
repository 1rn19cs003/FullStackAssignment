## Firstly letâ€™s create a web server:

## Navigate the cursor to the file I will create the project in the terminal and I am creating the package.json file with the following command:

```
npm init --y
```

## Now letâ€™s add the packages that are necessary to create the server and its purpose:

- **body-parser**: Middleware for parsing HTTP request body data.

- **colors**: A library for adding color to console logs (mostly for development/debugging).

- **connect-redis**: A Redis session store for Express sessions.

- **cookie-parser**: Middleware for parsing cookies from incoming HTTP requests.

- **cookie-session**: Middleware for handling session cookies.

- **cors**: Middleware for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Express applications.

- **dotenv**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`.

- **eslint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code.

- **express**: A web framework for building web applications and APIs in Node.js.

- **express-session**: Middleware for handling sessions in Express applications.

- **fs**: The built-in Node.js file system module for interacting with the file system.

- **helmet**: A collection of middleware for securing Express apps by setting various HTTP headers.

- **jsonwebtoken**: A library for creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for user authentication.

- **morgan**: Middleware for logging HTTP requests and responses in Express.

- **node**: This appears to be a placeholder or typo as it's not a valid npm package.

- **nodemon**: A utility that monitors for changes in your Node.js application and automatically restarts the server.

- **passport**: An authentication middleware for Node.js.

- **passport-local**: A Passport strategy for authenticating with a username and password.

- **pg**: A PostgreSQL client for Node.js.

- **pg-hstore**: A module for serializing and deserializing JSON data to hstore format in PostgreSQL.

- **sequelize**: An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for working with SQL databases in Node.js.

- **swagger-jsdoc**: A tool for generating Swagger documentation from JSDoc comments in your code.

- **swagger-ui-express**: Middleware for serving Swagger UI to visualize and interact with your API documentation.

- **ts-node**: A TypeScript execution environment and REPL for Node.js.

- **ts-node-dev**: A TypeScript development server with fast restarts and enhanced type checking.

- **typescript**: A superset of JavaScript that adds static types to the language.

- **winston**: A logging library for Node.js applications.

- **winston-daily-rotate-file**: A transport for rotating log files daily when using the Winston logger.


To install the necessary packages, run the following commands:

```bash
npm install body-parser colors connect-redis cookie-parser
npm install cookie-session cors dotenv eslint express
npm install express-session helmet jsonwebtoken morgan
npm install passport passport-local pg pg-hstore sequelize
npm install swagger-jsdoc swagger-ui-express ts-node ts-node-dev
npm install typescript winston winston-daily-rotate-file
```


## And finally, letâ€™s add the following code to scripts field in the package.json file.

```
"start": "nodemon index.js"
```

### If you donâ€™t have nodemon in your PC, I advise installing it globally.

```
sudo npm install -g nodemon
```

## Adding Swagger to the project

Firstly, letâ€™s install two modules that are necessary for documentation and user interface (UI):

```
npm install swagger-jsdoc swagger-ui-express
```

## And I am importing these two modules in the app.js file:

```JavaScript
const swaggerUi = require("swagger-ui-express");
const swaggerJsdoc = require("swagger-jsdoc");
```

# I have created a database schema, which is very basic. The primary motive was to create a server with features like authentication, authorization, error handling, and a logger to track API requests and responses. Currently, I am displaying these logs in the terminal. However, we can connect it to a database to store and track them. Additionally, one can create a trigger query to clean the old logs periodically


##
Database Schema can be seen here how I approached based on the problem statement

# API Documentation
The API is documented using [Swagger UI Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swagger-ui-express).
The generated docs will look like this :
The above swagger Screen shots have been attached you can see that in the upper section
## Running The Project Locally
Clone the Project in your local system or you can download the zip file and can extract it

To clone -
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/1rn19cs003/FullStackAssignment.git [folder_name_optional]
```

To run our application locally we need to execute the command below from the root folder of the project to install the required dependencies

```bash
npm install 
```
This should install the node_module package which has all the necessary packages to run the code
then to run your server you need to execute this command
```bash
$ npm start
```
This should launch a server at `http://localhost:{port}`. You may change port by modifying the value inside `.env`, which
I am assuming at PORT=3000.\
This should launch a new browser window with URL http://localhost:3000/. You'll see something similar as shown above.<br><br>

This should open a new browser window with the following message:
`Server is running at http://localhost:${PORT}/api/` where ${PORT} is set as an environment variable or defaulted to `3000`
```json
{"message":"Hello World!"}
```

If you want to test it out using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/), make sure your request has an **Authorization** header
If you see that, then congratulations ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠ You have successfully started your first Node Express Application Specification.
If you see that, then congratulations - your local environment is working correctly and ready for use. If not please raise an issue so it can
